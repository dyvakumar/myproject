TASK 1

What is your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you have worked on
professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but we would love to know why you are proud of it.


My greatest professional achievement was turning around the success of my last Employer’s WebSphere Migration Project team. I was hired to the team to migrate 200+ applications hosted in old(v6&v7) to New Version (V8.5). The billing to Migration Project will be given based on applications migrated succcessfully to RTL env's, For each application Customer pays INR 2 million. When I joined, the entire team (Team of 3 members) was struggling with configuration and we were failing to hit our quarterly goals. I had a plan on automating few tasks on Deployment tools and created templates, I figured it’d be the best way to improve things. Started desiging templates and implemented in a short span of time without any guidance. The team started following the approach and within 6 months, we were achieving 20-30% above our goals as well as avoided manual intervention on Configurations. My plan brought in an additional INR 40 million in revenue for the company through the second half of the year. This additional revenue brought the company from an operating loss each quarter to profitability. Also won the bidding based on performance and gained extending the project for next 1 year. This allowed me to practice planning a large-scale project and motivating a sizable group of employees. My Delivery Head was so pleased with the improvements and asked me to lead a training seminar in our London office.

Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it and why we should read it as well.

"The Industries of the Future" is a non-fiction book written by Alec Ross. Ross started his career as a Teacher and in 2000 he co-founded a technology based nonprofit organization called "One Economy". On this book, Ross refine his observations on the forces that are changing the world. He highlights the best opportunities for progress and explains how countries develop and suceed. Ross examines the specific fields like Information Technology that will shape our economic future over the next ten years, which includes technology like robotics, artificial intelligence, the commercialization of genomics, cybercrime and the impact of digital technology. On Integrating economic analysis, he answers questions on how we will need to adapt. Ross describes how other cultures have different reactions to robotics and he uses Japan's use of robotics in elder-care as an example. Ross gives readers a vivid and informed perspective on how sweeping global trends are affecting the ways we live, now and tomorrow. Also the book touches on how to prepare children for "success in a world of increasing change and competition" especially in tech world. Ross also focused on cybersecurity on networks and rearming of code.

I likes to read and suggest everyone in IT technology to read this book. This is by far the most eye-opening and mildly-distressing book I’ve ever read which indulgence in fiction and more on tech. Robots taking care of us, discoveries in genomic technology saving lives, farmers optimizing pastureland through a mobile app, and the countries entering a code war. Ross Alec looks in to more on countries like Africa, India and China.
